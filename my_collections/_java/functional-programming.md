# Functional Programming

* __What is Functional Programming?__  
Paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions,
and avoids changing-state and mutable data.  
Calling a Function with the same arguments always produces the same result.

* __What is a Lambda Expression?__  
It is a function which can be created without belonging to any class.  
It is an Anonymous Function: without name and without being bounded to an identifier. 

* __What is a functional interface?__  
It is a SAM Interface (Single Abstract Method Interface). Enforces the rule of Single Responsibility;
they can be marked with *@FunctionalInterface*.  
Lambda expressions can be used to represent the instance of a functional interface.

* __Where are Lambda Expressions used?__  
As event listeners or in Functional Programming with Java Stream API.

* __Java Stream API__  
Provides a functional approach to iterating and processing elements of a Collections.  


* __What is a Java Stream?__  
A Stream is a sequence of objects that supports various methods which can be pipelined 
to produce a desired result.  
    * it takes input from Collections, Arrays, I/O.
    * don't change the original data structure, they only provide the result.
