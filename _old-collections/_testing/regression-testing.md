# Regression Testing

Regression Testing is a type of testing done to verify that a
code change in the software does not impact the existing functionality
of the product. This is to make sure the product works fine with new
functionality, bug fixes or any change in the existing feature.  

Test cases are re-executed in order to check whether the previous version
of the application is working fine abd the new changes have not introduced
any new bugs.  

This test can be performed on a new build when there is a significant 
change in the original functionality that too even un a single bug fix.

Regression means retesting the unchanged parts of the application.
