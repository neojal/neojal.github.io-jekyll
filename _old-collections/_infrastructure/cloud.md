# Cloud Computing Core Concepts

### Intro

*Three types of cloud services*: 
1. software as a service (SaaS), e.g.
  * SalesForce
  * Microsoft 365
  * Google Apps for Work
2. infrastructure as a service (IaaS), e.g.
  * AWS
  * Azure
  * Google Cloud
3. platform as a service (PaaS), e.g.
  * Google Cloud
  
*Cloud Computing abilities:* 
* Leverage remote systems,
* Pay only for the resources you use,
* Scale up and back as needed.

*Deployment Modes:*
* Private,
* Public,
* Hybrid

### Deployment Modes

*Private* (More secure):
* You own the hardware that the cloud runs on.
* Runs on premises.
* Costly.

*Public* (Elastic scaling),
* Leveraging cloud services over the internet.
* Uses hardware and software that you don't own.
* Cheaper.

*Hybrid* (Seamless):
* Uses both public and private.

### Types of Clouds

1. software as a service (SaaS), 
  * Finished app that you rent and customize
  * Runs on web-browser, e.g.
    * CRM (customer relationship management) software
    * ERP (enterprise resource planning) software
    
  *Why SaaS Clouds?* 
  * no hardware neither install software.
  * unlimited scalability
  * automatic updates
  * support for desktop and mobile devices


2. infrastructure as a service (IaaS),
  * Deployment platform that abstracts infrastructure
  * Runs on data-centers
  * The provider hosts both Hardware and Sofware on behalf of the user.
  * Supports public, private, and hybrid deployment models. 
  
3. platform as a service (PaaS),
  * Deployment platform that abstracts infrastructure
  * Reduce appplication development and deployment costs
  * Provides a platform to develop, test, run, and manage applications without building and mantaining infrastructure.
