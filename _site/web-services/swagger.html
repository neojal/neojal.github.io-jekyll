<p>Documentation for REST webservices.</p>

<p>Swagger is an OpenSource framework where you can document your Restful API’s,
 access them, as well as test your services.</p>

<h2 id="swagger-jsonyaml-documentation">Swagger JSON/yaml documentation</h2>

<p>Technology independent, swagger json/yaml describes the resources and operations present in the API, 
as well as details of each operation such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Define services hosted, paths.</li>
  <li>consumes: what kind of request is accepted.</li>
  <li>produces: what kind of response is produced.</li>
  <li>paths: what are the different resources available.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="swagger-integration">Swagger Integration.</h2>
<p>Swagger can be integrated with REST APIs in two ways:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A top-down approach: First API specification and then code generation.
    <ul>
      <li>swagger-codegen.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>A bottom-up approach: First API code and then Swagger integration.
    <ul>
      <li>This is the typical scenario.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="how-to-generate-swagger-json">how to generate swagger json?</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Options:
  a) Swagger OpenAPI: annotate classes with swagger.
  b) SpringFox (Swagger Integration with Spring): No handwritten documentation,
  it can generate a lot of information about your api just by inspecting classes.
  c) Swagger-Maven plugin: generates swagger spec at build time from swagger-annotated classes.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="swagger-annotations">Swagger Annotations</h2>

<p>@API<br />
Acts at the class level and is used to mark a class as a Swagger Resource.</p>

<p>@SwaggerDefinition<br />
Acts at the class level to define information in a Swagger Resource.</p>

<p>@ApiOperation<br />
Acts at the method level to describe Swagger operation.</p>

<p>@ApiImplicitParam<br />
Acts at the method level to describe the properties of the parameters of the operation.</p>

<p>@ApiResponse<br />
Describes the meaning of the HTTP status response code.</p>
